# topic-model-specificity-comparison
How do different topic models handle corpora of varying generality? 

Topic models seem to do a better job when the data is more general. But as the data gets more specific, the models become more finicky with the number of topics and iteration, until, with a small dataset from a niche domain, they're virtually useless. My aim here is to test out different topic models with datasets of varying specificity to understand which topic models can handle more specificity and under what conditions that happens.
